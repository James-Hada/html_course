	<p>Levels of measurement, also called scales of measurement, tell you how precisely variables are recorded. In scientific research, a variable is anything that can take on different values across your data set <br>(e.g., height or test scores).</p>
	There are 4 levels of measurement:
		<li><strong>Nominal:</strong> the data can only be categorized</li>
		<div style="height: 3px"></div>
		<li><strong>Ordinal:</strong> the data can be categorized and ranked</li>
		<div style="height: 3px"></div>
		<li><strong>Interval:</strong> the data can be categorized, ranked, and evenly spaced</li>
		<div style="height: 3px"></div>
		<li><strong>Ratio:</strong> the data can be categorized, ranked, evenly spaced, and has a natural zero.</li>

			<br>Depending on the level of measurement of the variable, what you can do to analyze your data may be limited. There is a hierarchy in the complexity and precision of the level of measurement, from low (nominal) to high (ratio).
	<p>
		<h3>NOMINAL SCALES</h3>
		In nominal scales, numbers, such as driver’s license numbers and product serial numbers, are used to name or identify people, objects, or events. Gender is an example of a nominal measurement in which a number (e.g., 1) is used to label one gender, such as males, and a different number (e.g., 2) is used for the other gender, females. Numbers do not mean that one gender is better or worse than the other; they simply are used to classify persons. 
		<br>In fact, any other numbers could be used, because they do not represent an amount or a quality. It is impossible to use word names with certain statistical techniques, but numerals can be used in coding systems. For example, fire departments may wish to examine the relationship between gender <b>(where male = 1, female = 2)</b> and performance on physical-ability tests (with numerical scores indicating ability).</p>
	<p>
		<h3>ORDINAL SCALES</h3>
		In ordinal scales, numbers represent rank order and indicate the order of quality or quantity, but they do not provide an amount of quantity or degree of quality. <br>Usually, the number 1 means that the person (or object or event) is better than the person labeled 2; person 2 is better than person 3, and so forth—for example, to rank order persons <br>in terms of potential for promotion, with the person assigned the 1 rating having more potential than the person assigned a rating of 2. Such ordinal scaling does not, however, indicate how much more potential the leader has over the person assigned a rating of 2, and there may be very little difference between <strong>1</strong> and <strong>2</strong> here. <br>When ordinal measurement is used (rather than interval measurement), certain statistical techniques are applicable (e.g., Spearman’s rank correlation).</p>
	<p>
		<h3>INTERVAL SCALE</h3>
		In interval scales, numbers form a continuum and provide information about the amount of difference, but the scale lacks a true zero. The differences between adjacent numbers are equal or known. <br>If zero is used, it simply serves as a reference point on the scale but does not indicate the complete absence of the characteristic being measured. The Fahrenheit and Celsius temperature scales <br>are examples of interval measurement. In those scales, <strong>0 °F and 0 °C</strong> do not indicate an absence of temperature.
